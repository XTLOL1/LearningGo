# LearningGo
 - Created go module
 - Wrote hello world and tests with TDD
 - Learned that ```go test``` only works when used in the subfolder, but ```go test ./...``` on root will test all subfolders recursively
 - Started messing around with integers
 - Learned iteration, and also sprinkled some generics in the middle
 - Learned the difference between arrays and slices, and how to make them generic as well
 - Next step is more iteration and then structs, interfaces and that sort of stuff
